# The CAM-PAL Issue Tracker

Heroku App: https://fullstack-django-issuetracker.herokuapp.com<br>
GitHub: https://github.com/Sonnerz/project05-fullstack-django<br>


## Guidelines and Guideline fulfilment

1.	**Build a web app that fulfills some actual (or imagined) real-world need. This can be of your choosing and may be domain specific.**<br>
This web app was created to support the end users of a software product called CAM-PAL. The web app allows users to submit bugs for investigation and request features for development.
2.	**Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.**<br>
Readme supplied
3.	**The project must be a brand-new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each reusable component in your project).**<br>
This is a new Django project composed of seven apps; accounts, blog, cart, checkout, issues, pages & search
4.	**The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so. e.g., a user would have to register to persist their shopping cart between sessions (otherwise it would be lost).**<br>
There is an authentication system allowing users to register and log in. It is needed to persist users shopping cart, allow users view their orders and track if the user should have access to the Blog app. <br>
5.	**At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout, subscription-based payments or single payments, etc.**<br>
Users can pay for Feature development and they must do this by purchasing development hours. The purchase of hours is tracked using a cart app and checkout app. Purchases are processed using Stripe.
6.	**Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism).**<br>
Users are able to create bugs and edit their own bugs. Users are able to create features and edit their own features. All users can create comments about bugs, and some users can comment on blog posts. Admins can update reported comments and edit all bugs and features.<br>
7.	**The project will need to connect to a database (e.g., SQLite or Postgres) using Django’s ORM**<br>
The project connected to a SQLite database during development and a Postgres database when hosted on Heroku.<br>
8.	**The UI should be responsive, use either media queries or a responsive framework such as Bootstrap to make sure that the site looks well on all commonly-used devices.**<br>
Bootstrap4 and custom css/media queries are used throughout. The site has been tested to prove responsiveness on all commonly-used devices. <br>
9.	**As well as having a responsive UI, the app should have a great user experience.**<br>
I hope the app has a great user experience.
10.	**10.	The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic to enhance the user experience.**<br>
The frontend has AJAX incorporated, to enhance the user experience completing forms.
11.	**Whenever relevant, the backend should integrate with third-party Python/Django packages, such as Django Rest Framework, etc. Strive to choose the best tool for each purpose and avoid reinventing the wheel, unless your version of the wheel is shinier (and if so, consider also releasing your wheel as a standalone open source project).**<br>
Third-Party packages used: 
django-forms-bootstrap, Pillow, dj-database-url, psycopg2, gunicorn, stripe, coverage, codecov, django-filter, django-simple-poll, django-storages, boto3
12.	**Make sure to test your project extensively. In particular, make sure that no unhandled exceptions are visible to the users, under any circumstances. Use automated Django tests wherever possible. For your JavaScript code, consider using Jasmine tests.**<br>
Browser testing using Chrome dev tools was used continuously throughout development. Unit testing  is implemented into each app. As of the deployment date, coverage is at 76%.
CSS and JS was validated using standard online tools. See [Testing](#testing) section.
13.	**Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.**<br>
Git and GitHub used throughout development with each major update committed.
14.	**Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.**<br>
The final version is deployed to Heroku using AWS to host static and media files.

# PREFACE

I have developed a fictitious phone application which can configure a DSLR camera to the optimum settings for that location or subject.
After purchasing the software, the user installs the app on their iOS or Android phone.
By either Bluetooth or WIFI, the phone can connect to the camera, and configure the camera settings to take the best photograph for that environment.
The app can adjust all the standard camera settings such as, ISO, WB, and Focal Point.

I have created a website where customers who register can submit software bugs or request new features to be developed for a fee.
To complete the customer experience, we also provide a blog area paying customers can access.

When a customer submits an issue, that issue is given a unique reference number. Using this number as a form of identity, the customer can follow the progress of that issue from submission, through to issuing a solution.

For a customer to request a new feature they must commit a minimum of €100 to pay for two hours of work reviewing the new feature request. The Developer then updates the feature with the number of hours required to fully develop, test and deploy the new feature. Users can contribute to the development of the feature by buying hours. When the required number of hours specified by the developer has been funded, the feature is then developed.

# Future updates
1)  ability to assign development to other developers as the site grows
2)  app to log and track development hours against a feature or bug
3)  add rich text editor to Blog

<a id="strategy"></a>

# Strategy Plane
The overall aim of the project is to create a web application that allows users to submit bugs for fixing and pay for additional features. The logic of the app will be written using a variety of technologies but predominantly using the Django framework, jQuery, SQLite and Postgres.  HTML, and CSS will be used to enhance the look and feel of the application, while JavaScript will be used to enhance the user experience.


<a id="randr"></a>

## Define roles and responsibilities
For the purposes of this project, Sonya Cooley has full authority, primary responsibility, and full accountability for all aspects of the project.

<a id="def"></a>

## Defensive Design
Defensive design for our Issue Tracker application will focus on the most common points of failure: user input areas, feedback and server problems.
*   I will employ form validation to check for user mistakes before they frustrate the user
*   I will protect users from server errors and broken links with informative messages
*   My Defensive design will assist the user before mistakes happen.

If users are unsuccessful with any input field, they will be informed by on screen messages that will give clear instructions on how to resolve the issue.
The ‘Registration’ form will ask users to enter a username to appear on the application. They will be informed if that username has already been taken and asked to enter a different username. The form will have validation and offer clear instructions to users on how to proceed.

Every form will have required input fields. Users will be informed via tooltips if they have failed to complete a required field.

Users who attempt to access pages that do not exist will be shown a custom 404 page.
Unregistered Users who attempt to gain access to pages other than the index page will be redirected to the login in page

Registered Users who have not contributed towards feature development and attempt to gain access to the Blog will be redirected to the internal home page - accounts/acc_index/

Environmental variables have been used to protect access details to the database, AWS access and Stripe processing.

<a id="scope"></a>

# Scope Plane
The project scope is based on our defined Strategy.
Scoping will;
*   fully define the web application requirements 
*   determine the key functionalities
*   determine what features are to be included in this and possible future application releases

The Issue Tracker application will target professional and amateur photographers. A combination of images, and HTML5 will be used to make the interface useful and interesting. Semantic HTML will be used throughout and the site will be responsive to a broad range of devices. 
 
Registered users will be able to add bugs, track their progress and make comments.
Registered users can request new features by paying for the review and development of that feature. A minimum amount will be required to make that request and have it reviewed and a  minimum total amount will be required to develop the feature.

Site content will be stored in SQLite during development and a Postgres database in production. 
Python, Django framework, JavaScript and SQLite and Postgres will be the primary technologies used to implement the web application functionality.

<a id="scenarios"></a>

## Scenarios/User stories

### Professional photographer:
A professional photographer would have invested in the auto settings app to add it as another tool in their photography kit. They would be keen to submit any issues they had found while using the app as the tool contributes to their livelihood. They would also be interested in expanding the app possibilities by proposing new features which would help in resolving issues that might regularly occur during their commissions.

### Amateur photographer:
An amateur photographer may invest in the auto settings app to help improve their technique or help teach them how to get correct camera settings. 
An amateur will probably only submit bugs for fixing and not invest in any new features. They may not have enough motivation to request new features.

#  Structure & Skeleton Plane

Our goal for the Structure plane is to organise the information architecture and interactions for the application. We will keep a consistent, predictable, and learnable interface that users should be familiar with if they regularly use the internet. We will use industry standard technologies to implement expected behaviours when using the application, e.g. tooltips, navigation, including accessibility, etc.
Users will find navigation and user information at the top of the application. 
The input fields will follow user expectations where feedback is provided if user interactions are unexpected, correct or incorrect.



<a id="architecture"></a>
## Information architecture
The application directories and files will be organised in the following way;

<ul><li>Site Root</li><ul><li>App: accounts</li><li>App: blog</li><li>App: cart</li><li>App: checkout</li><li>App: htmlcov</li><li>App: issues</li><li>Project: issuetracker</li><li>media</li><li>App: pages</li><li>App: search</li><li>static</li><li>templates</li><li>.gitignore</li><li>.travis.yml</li><li>custom_storages.py</li><li>manage.py</li><li>Procfile</li><li>requirements.txt</li><li>ReadMe.md</li></ul></ul>

### Version Control

Git was used to manage the source code for this project. Git is a version control system for tracking changes in project files.
Project files were committed to Git after each major functional addition, update or implementation of testing results.
Following the initial commit to Git, each major update was followed by a Git add and commit. 
**A full Git log is available on the GitHub project repository**.

<a id="devtest"></a>

### Development

##  HTML
https://bootswatch.com/superhero/	: is used for the issues site<br>
https://bootswatch.com/spacelab/	: is used for the blog app<br>

##  CSS
Custom css and bootstrap overrides : static/css/custom.css


##  Python
The web app follows the standard Django pattern; forms, models and views.
The following apps are based on apps created during course lessons: accounts, cart, checkout and search. I have used them as a starting point and customised them for my project.

##  jQuery
jQuery is implemented on the registration form and password reset form.
*   The jquery on the registration form checks the database for the username and ensures that the username entered is unique.
*   The jquery on the password reset form checks the database for the email and ensures that the email exists in the database.
*   jQuery is used to set some form fields to readonly.
*   jQuery is used to show/hide the donate form on the feature details page.
*   jQuery is used to add a css class to the link to highlight it as being active.
*   jQuery styles the button for the status filter.
*   jQuery applies Smooth scrolling to the home page


[Top of page](#top)

<a id="testing"></a>

## Testing

The app was tested on an ongoing basis. Chrome and Chrome Developer Tools were the primary browser and tool used for testing. However, the site was also tested using Firefox and Internet Explorer.
*   CSS passed validation using the CSS Validation Service provided by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
*   Pep8 was used to apply a standard coding convention to the Python code
*   PyLint was also installed and used
*   All the functions in custom_scripts.js were tested on http://jshint.com/
This site is a tool that helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code.

#### During development:
*   print() was used extensively for viewing returned data and testing. 
*   Console.log() was used viewing the ajax response and testing. 
*   Div’s had vibrant background colours so that the developer was easily able to identify them
*   Each change was viewed in a chrome browser and tested using developer tools at full width resolution and using a variety of device emulators; Galaxy SIII, Galaxy 5, Laptop touch screen, iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad.
*   The site was pushed to Heroku and tested on mobile devices.

#### Development/Defensive Design Testing
Testing was carried out continuously while developing the app. New functionality was tested in the browser until it was working as expected.

As per the Defensive Design Strategy described in the Strategy Plan, all form inputs are checked for empty values. Users are messaged if they click a submit button without providing text.

Debug mode was set to False to test 500 and 404 errors.

### User Testing

**Issues and Resolution**

1) After editing a bug the screen redirects to all bugs view<br>
    -  This was changed to redirect back to the bug details screen
2) yellow debug screen for a 404
    -  I set debug to False on settings.py
3) View feature details button overflows on a mobile
    -  I shortened the button text
4) Burger menu off screen on mobile
    -  This was related to the issue 3. The button was pushing the burger off screen
5) Don't know what status user filtered by
    -  Change the view code to get the request status and passed it back to the page as a variable. This gives user feedback.


### Unit Testing

Each app has its own python test file for app, forms and views.
Currently Coverage shows 76% complete.

Heroku is used to host the code and publish the app publicly.

I logged into Heroku and created a new app called **fullstack-django-issuetracker**<br>
I chose the European hosting region<br>
A git repo was created: https://git.heroku.com/fullstack-django-issuetracker.git<br>
A heroku app url was provided: https://fullstack-django-issuetracker.herokuapp.com<br>
I synced the Heroku app with the GitHub repo


**Issues and Resolution**

There were many trial and errors. Mainly the coveralls failed.
I found it difficult to get codecov and coveralls to work on Travis.
I tried codecov and then coveralls.
